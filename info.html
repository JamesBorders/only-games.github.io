     <p class="text-center">Hello, sorry for going entirely dark for the past few months, my school banned this site so I stopped working on it, I had no idea that this site blew up. I initially made this website just as a little fun for me and my friends when 
	 we get bored in class but now I see that so many people have started using it too. Today I looked up my site and went to check and went to check the feedback and I had 172 suggesitons! Weirdly they started coming in the same month I stopped work on this site.
	 Judging by these replies there is a lot of work that could be done on this site which I will now start updating. To make this site worth my time I may put up ads but only on the main pages so that I don't disrupt any gaming.
	 According to some of the feedback, I apparently have beef with another website called "gamesforsite" which I have never heard of and apparently they said my site is lame, it was never meant to be anything big just some fun for me and my friends.
	 I'm also thinking of starting a discord server to make things easier and so I can connect with you guys but I don't actually know how many active users I get so I am setting up analytics to check that before I go any further.
	 And lastly I would just like to thank everyone who uses this site even if I didn't know they existed! As for everyone who gave feedback, I will try my best to implement all of it but I don't make any promises as of now.</p>

	 	 <p class="text-center">also to everyone who asks about a search bar, I have no idea how to add one so just use ctrl+f for now, I suprisingly don't know much HTML</p>
		 <p class="text-center">oh and also no, I cannot add roblox.</p>
